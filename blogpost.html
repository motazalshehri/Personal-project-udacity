        <p><u>Turmeric</u> is becoming so popular these days, you may have ordered it in a 'golden latte' before really knowing what it is.</p>

        <p>But although the spice has only become western trend in recent years, it's been an Indian staple for millennia - used for everything from spicing up a meal to dyeing a dress.</p>

        <p><b>What is turmeric?</b></p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric">Turmeric</a> - also called <i>'Indian Saffron' </i> - is part of the ginger family. As a rule of thumb, if you can't stand ginger candy, you probably won't care for Turmeric. The
          above ground part of the turmeric plant consists of tall, narrow stems, each topped by a distinctive white or pink flower. But if you're fascinated by turmeric as a health nut, not a herbologist, you're probably more interested in
          its root. The turmeric root looks like a mini, dark orange version of ginger. The root you're buying at your local health store was probably grown in India, although the plant can be grown in many tropical countries. When dried
          and ground up into a powder, turmeric root gives a golden tinge to whatever dish - or increasingly drink - you put it in. Hence golden lattes, golden milk, golden tea, and golden ice cream! In fact, you can think of turmeric as
          the king midas of roots.
